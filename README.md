### DDoS attacks occur when a cyber-criminal floods a targeted organization's network with access requests; this initially disrupts service by denying legitimate requests from actual customers, and eventually overloads the network until it crashes.

<br>

### Criminals execute their DDoS attacks by sending out malicious code to hundreds or even thousands of computers, instructing each one to send requests to a single organization. This is usually accomplished through a botnet; a network of private computers infected with malicious software that is controlled as a group, without the knowledge of each individual owner.
